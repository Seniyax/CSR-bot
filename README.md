# ðŸ§   RAG-powered Customer Support Chatbot
This Repository includes a lightweight **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** Chat bot for Customer support in Tech domain.
## Objective 
To create a compact, efficient and cost-free chatbot system that:
- Accepts user queries
- Retrieves relevant documents using embeddings
- Generates human-like answers using a small instruction-tuned language model
- Can Run on a Computer with no GPU 
## Architecture
Used a Standard RAG Architecture

## Data & Embeddings
Used a Custom dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter) which was split into chunks and converted into vector embeddings using all-Mini-l6-v2,These embeddings were uploded into **Pinecoe** and queried at runtime via similarity search (top_k=5).

ðŸ§  Model Used: `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct`

## Resons for SmolLM2
- Very Lightweight (135M parameters) - run easily on any computer.
- Fast Inference even with minimal hardware.
- Support Instruction following natively.
## Workflow
- Uses LangChainâ€™s RetrievalQA chain (stuff mode)
- Prompt template includes both context and question
- Answer is generated by SmolLM2 based on provided context

 **Local LLM inference on limited compute** ,Many open LLMs (like Mistral, Falcon, etc.) require >8GB VRAM,Switched to `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct`, which fits on any computer for local inference.
 ## Tech Stack used
- Python 3.9+
- Gradio
- Hugging face
- LangChain
- Pinecone-vector db
- NLTK
- Spacy
## Future Improvements 
- Replace SmolLM2 with Mistral 7B (if GPU available)
- Extending the knowledge base for more direct answers
- Developing as a Agentic-RAG
## Acknowledgements
- Hugging Face for model & transformers
- Pinecone for free-tier vector search
- LangChain for fast RAG prototyping
- Gradio for interactive frontend
